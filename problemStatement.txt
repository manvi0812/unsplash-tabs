Problem Statement: Design an interactive user interface that allows users to manage multiple tabs with the ability to open, delete, edit, and view content associated with each tab when it is active.

Description:
In today's digital world, users often work with multiple tabs or windows simultaneously to manage 
different tasks or projects. However, existing tab management systems lack user-friendly features 
for organizing and manipulating tab content efficiently. Therefore, there is a need for an intuitive 
interface that enables users to open, delete, edit, and easily access relevant content within each active tab.

The problem can be further elaborated by outlining the key requirements and challenges:

1. Opening Tabs: Users should be able to open new tabs and switch between them effortlessly. The interface
 should provide clear indicators to show which tab is currently active.

2. Deleting Tabs: Users should have the ability to close or delete tabs they no longer need. The interface 
should provide a convenient way to perform this action while preserving any unsaved data or offering a prompt for confirmation.

3. Editing Tabs: Users may need to rename or modify the properties of individual tabs. The interface should 
allow users to edit tab titles or other metadata, providing a seamless way to update tab information.

4. Viewing Tab Content: When a tab is active, users should be able to view and interact with the content 
associated with that tab. The interface should provide a dedicated area to display the content, whether
 it is a document, webpage, or any other form of digital information.

5. Organizing Tab Content: Users may want to organize or group related tabs together for easier navigation.
 The interface should support grouping or categorizing tabs based on user-defined criteria, enabling 
 efficient management of complex workflows.

6. Intuitive User Experience: The interface should be intuitive, with clear visual cues and 
easy-to-use controls for tab management. Users should be able to perform actions such as 
opening, deleting, editing, and viewing content with minimal effort and without the need for extensive 
learning or training.

By addressing the challenges outlined above, the proposed solution will enhance user productivity 
and provide a seamless tab management experience, empowering users to efficiently handle multiple tasks
or projects simultaneously.
